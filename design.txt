Server is the dealer, dealing cards to all players (clients)
	Although server is dealing, we still need a 'dealer' position to determine proper betting order
The functionality of betting rounds will have to vary depending on how many players there are:
	2-players (aka heads-up play):
		dealer index = small blind
		dealer index + 1 = big blind
		dealer index goes first pre-flop
		dealer index goes last post-flop
	3+ players (standard):
		dealer index + 1 = small blind
		dealer index + 2 = big blind
		dealer index + 3 goes first pre-flop (under the gun)
		dealer index + 1 goes first post-flop

	Rules:
	Small blind can be however much 
	Big blind is atleast 2x small blind
	Action continues clockwise (+1) through all players after starting player
	Each player can call (match the big blind), raise (increase bet amount), or fold.
	Traditionally, minimum raise is the size of the previous bet or raise in that round. (size of the big blind for round 1)
	If no one has raised when the action gets to the big blind, they can "check" (stay in without adding more money) or raise
